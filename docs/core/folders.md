Folders act as a way to hierarchically organize connections by area/projects and also used as permission container.

Folders have no limit of nesting levels.

If a folder has no parent - it is a root folder.

If a permission is granted to access a folder - it automatically allows access for all connections inside it and all descendant folders.
